1. Fixed issue in script.js where Event Listener didn't set saved theme when DOM content loaded due to typo
2. Fixed footer alignment issue in portfolio.html due to incorrect selector used in css
3. Added margin-bottom for form button in contact.html so footer doesn't cut off page directly under it
4. Added :hover class to form button in contact.html for improved UX & interactivity
